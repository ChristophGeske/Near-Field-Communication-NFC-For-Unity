# Near-Field-Communication-NFC-For-Unity-Android
Simple NFC app created with Unity

Feel free to use this project to create your own Unity Android app which can read out NFC tags.

This app is not able to write informations onto NFC tags. Feel free to add this functionality yourself if you like.

This project was inspired by this forum discussion. Check it out to learn more about the code and how to scan multiple tags.
